the old guy in the building saw you, as a young student, u are obligated to do this side quest.

the side quest is to get the cat in the top floor and get it back here ( first floor).


how to move objects in linux ? 

-using a command called mv, mv + filename + placetoMove.

currently the old guy wants you to move it here.

to know where is here exactly in the system, u can use pwd (print working directory).

after that u can do mv + cat + current directory.
