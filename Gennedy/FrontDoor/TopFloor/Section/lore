as the first student and only attendent in the section, the teaching assistant is so angry, as a respond, she tells you to get out a paper and write your ID, to give you full bonus grades.

to create a paper u will have to use this command : touch paper.

after creating the paper (text file) u will have to write your name on it, to do this we will introduce u to a common text editor in linux, nano.

GNU nano is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. 

to open a text file and be able to edit it, u will do nano + filename.

after opening paper, put your name and save it.

a paper here is a text file.
