In Linux/UNIX, Files are mainly categorized into 3 parts:

Regular Files
Directory Files
Special Files

The easiest way to find out file type in any operating system is by looking at its extension such as .txt, .sh, .py, etc.
If the file doesnâ€™t have an extension then in Linux we can use file utility.


for example the file u just accessed is called Regular file, while the folder u accessed to get here is called Directory.

and to continue this game u will have to access a file called lore.sh which is a special file called executable.

to access or execute it's contents u have to do ./ + name, and there is a other way, by doing . + name .

in our case we want to do the other way, so it will be . lore.sh .


how to identify what type is a file ? we use the following command : 

file + name 

so if we wanted to know which type of file is lore.sh we simply do file lore.sh
