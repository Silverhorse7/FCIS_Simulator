now we will learn together the most essential and basic commands in Linux systems !

first we will start with three commands : 

cat file : outputs the contents of a text file

cd directory : goes into a folder/directory

ls : outputs the contents of a folder/directory


now you are on Ain shams University, as a FCIS student, u only have two options, faculty and Gennedy's building, each leads to a different scenario.
