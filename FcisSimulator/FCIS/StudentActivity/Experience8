well for some reason, another student wanted to take your subject.

the good person u are again, u gave it to him.

now you want to remove the directory/folder u just made a few minutes ago.

the command for this is : $ rmdir subjectName                                                             
rmdir : Removes a directory                                                
you saw an error saying "Directory not empty". you didn't know what to    
do, so you tried to type $ rm, but you saw a different error saying           
"Is a directory". you wondered if there was anything that would help you      
solve this problem until you found the magic solution, which was $ man rm     
man : It will show you the manual of the command name                      
the man page told me that                                                  
the flag -r : removes directories and their contents recursively.          
Now you can delete the whole subject material drive by typing $ rm -r subjectName
