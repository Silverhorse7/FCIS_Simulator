you can add subjects to a specific day

But beacause you want to display it inside your day you used the redirection operator >   
> : It's a redirection operator which redirects our output to the file.                     
> Note : > : It will override whatâ€™s in the file. To avoid that use >>               
>> :It's a redirection operator which appends to a file without deleting its content 
Now your turn show us your calendar ^_^ .
